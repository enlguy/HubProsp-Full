  description: "Helping a Global Staffing Corporation Save Millions"
  content: "We worked with a global staffing corporation based in the UK, with offices all over the globe.  They had over 20,000 records in HubSpot, and over 50% of these had bad data.  Sales reps weren't generally entering all the data values that were needed for marketing to do their jobs, and didn't even know what marketing needed.  Imagine how much money was being flushed down the toilet when half their customer records didn't even have basic data points needed to provide simple reports and allow marketing to contact them appropriately!  HubProsper created data policies to be implemented at the C-suite level, across multiple departments, to ensure sales and marketing could work with each other, not against each other.  
  &nbsp;  
  
  &nbsp;  
    
  We also worked diligently to align all data.  Missing fields were given their proper values through large data migrations, using automations to be as efficient as possible in cleaning the data as it came in, as well as maintaining clean data across all records in the Contacts database.  We normalized everything, so \"CEO\" was one job title, instead of having \"CEO,\" \"C.E.O,\" \"Chief Executive Officer,\" \"Chief Exec Officer,\" \"Chief Executive,\" .... you get the idea.  There was no good way to segment and target CEOs when entering \"CEO\" for the title was missing countless CEOs in the recrods.
    &nbsp;  
  
  &nbsp;  
    
 Once we had complete and consistent data across all records, we de-duplicated against the multiple data imports from various sources to ensure data was tight, and no one person would get multiple emails from a single campaign.  Now the data was actually ready to be used.
    &nbsp;  
  
  &nbsp;  
    
We also created and implemented a lead scoring system that would let them see, at a high level, which leads were more valuable to the company, and should be pursued at a higher priority level."
